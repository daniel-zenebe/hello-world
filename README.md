# hello-world
I am trying to accomplish a passing mark in Web Design.  I struggle with a desire to learn, however this year I am going to try to push
myself to achieve my goals in this course.  I view this year as my last chance.  Also I have Visual Studio 2019 instead
since it was already downloaded and it seems to be working.  Would this be an issue later on in the course or should I switch.
